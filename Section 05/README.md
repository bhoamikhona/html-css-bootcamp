# Section 05: Web Design Rules and Framework

**About:** This section is all about learning the basics of web desing including: Typography, Colors, Images and Illustrations, Icons, Shadows, Border-radius, Whitespace, Visual Hierarchy, User Experience and then applying them in a web development project.

## Lessons Learned

- Web Design vs. Web Development
  - Web designers create the overall look and feel of a website.
  - Web developers implement the design using HTML, CSS, and Javascript code.
- Why take design seriously?
  | Good Design | Bad Design |
  | ----------- | ----------- |
  | Created an immediate and lasting **good impression** of the brand or product | Makes users believe the brand doesn't really care about their product or service |
  | Makes the user **trust** the brand right away | Makes the user insecure about trusting the brand |
  | Increases the user's **perceived value** of the brand or product | Makes the brand or product seem 'cheap' |
  | Gives users exactly **what they were looking for** when coming to the site e.g. purchasing a product or finding information | Leaves users confused, and makes it hard for them to reach their goal |
- Good web design is **not subjective or creative**
- Everyone can learn basics by following a **framework/system**

- Web Design Ingredients:

  - Typography
  - Colors
  - Images/Illustrations
  - Icons
  - Shadows
  - Border Radius
  - Whitespace
  - Visual Hierarchy
  - User Experience
  - Components/Layouts

- Website Personalities
  - Serious/Elegant: For luxury and elegance, based on this serif typefaces, golden or pastel colors, and big high-quality images.
  - Minimalist/Simple: Focusses on the essential text content, using small or medium-sized sans-serif black text, lines, and few images and icons.
  - Plain/Neutral: Design that gets out of the way by using neutral and small typefaces, and a very structured layout. Common in big corporations.
  - Bold/Confident: Makes an impact by featuring big and bold typography, paired with confident use or big and bright colored blocks.
  - Calm/Peaceful: For products and services that care, transmitted by calming pastel colors, soft serif headings, and matching images/illustrations.
  - Startup/Upbeat: Widely used in startups, featuring medium-sized sans-serif typefaces, light-grey text and backgrounds, and rounded elements.
  - Playful/Fun: Colorful and round designs, fueled by creative elements like hand-drawn icons or illustrations, animations, and fun language.

### Design

- Typography:
  - Typography is all about making text beautiful and easy to read.
  - Serif vs. Sans-Serif
    | Serif | Sans-Serif |
    | ----------- | ----------- |
    | Creates a traditional/classic look and feel | Modern look and feel |
    | Conveys trustworthiness | Clean and Simple |
    | Good for long text | Easier to choose for beginner designer |
  - Use only good and popular typfaces and play it safe.
    - sans-serif typface e.g. Inter, Open Sans, Roboto, Montserrat, Work Sans, Lato
    - serif typface e.g. Merriweather, Aleo, Playfair Display, Cormorant, Cardo, Lora
  - It's okay to use just one typeface per page! If you want more, limit to 2 typefaces.
  - Choose the **right typeface** according to your website personality:
    - Choose the right personality for your website.
    - Decide between a serif and sans-serif typeface.
    - Experiment with all the "good" typefaces (and other typefaces from Google Fonts!) to see which ones best fit your website's message (this will come with experience).
    - You can keep trying different typefaces as your design and build the page.
  - Font Sizes and Weights
    - When choosing font-sizes, **limit choices!** Use a **"type scale"** tool or other **pre-defined range**.
    - Use a font-size between 16px and 32px for **normal** text.
    - For **long text** (like a blog post), try a size of 20px or even bigger.
    - For **headlines**, you can go really big (50px+) and bold (600+), **depending on personality**.
    - For any text, don't use a font weight under 400 (regular)
  - Good Reading Experience
    - Use less than 75 characters per line.
    - For normal-sized text, use a line height between 1.5 and 2. For big text, go below 1.5
      - The **smaller** or **longer** the text, the **larger** the line height needs to be!
    - Decrease letter spacing in headlines, if it looks unnatural (this will come from experience)
    - Experiment with all caps for short titles. Make them small and bold and increase letter-spacing
    - Usually, don't justify text.
    - Don't center long text blocks. Small blocks are fine.
- Colors
  - Make the main color **match your website's personality**: colors convey meaning.
    - **Red** draws a lot of attention, and symbolizes power, passion, and excitement.
    - **Orange** is less aggressive, and conveys happiness, cheerfulness, and creativity
    - **Yellow** means joy, brightness, and intelligence
    - **Green** represent harmony, nature, growth, and health
    - **Blue** is associated with peace, trustworthiness, and professionalism
    - **Purple** conveys wealth, wisdom, and magic
    - **Pink** represents romance, care, and affection
    - **Brown** is associated with nature, durability, and comfort
    - **Black** symbolizes power, elegance, minimalism but also, grief and sorrow.
  - Use a good color tone.
  - Establish a color system
    - You need at least two types of colors in your color palette: a main color and a grey color
    - With more experience, you can add more color: accent colors
    - For diversity, create lighter and darker versions (tints and shades)
  - When and How to use colors
    - Use your main color to draw attention to the most important elements on the page.
    - Use colors to add interesting accents or make entire components or sections stand out.
    - You can try to use your color strategically in images and illustrations
- Colors and Typography
  - On dark colored backgrounds, try to use a tint of the background ("lighter version") for text.
  - Text should usually not be completely black. Lighten it up if it looks heavy and uninviting.
  - Don't make text too light. Use a tool to check contrast between text and background colors.
    - Contrast ratio needs to be at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text (18px+)
- Images & Illustrations
  - 4 Different Types of Images:
    - Product Photos
    - Storytelling Photos
    - Illustrations
    - Patterns
  - Use images to support your website's message and story. So only use relevant images.
  - Prefer original images. If not possible, use original-looking stock images (not generic ones).
  - Try to show real people to trigger user's emotions.
  - If necessary, crop images to fit your message.
  - Experiment combining photos, illustrations, and patterns.
- Handling Text on Images
  - Darken or Brighten image (completely or partially using a gradient)
  - Position the text into neutral image area.
  - Put text in a box
- Technical details when using images
  - Account for high resolution screens, make image dimensions 2x as big as their displayed size.
    - Scale Factor: Actual pixels the screen contains/Pixels represented on screen.
    - On high-resolution screens, scale factor is 2x or even 3x, on "normal" screens it's just 1x (1 physical pixel = 1 design pixel)
    - Compress images for a lower file size and better performance.
    - When using multiple images side-by-side, make sure they have the exact same dimensions.
- Icons
  - Use a good icon pack, there are tons of free and paid icons packs.
  - Use only one icon pack. Don't mix icons from different icon packs.
  - Use SVG icons or icon fonts. Don't use bitmap image formats (.jpg and .png).
    - SVG and icon fonts are vector based which means they can scale indefinitely.
    - Bitmap image fromats like .jpg and .png do not scale and become unsharp - this will be a problem on HD screens.
  - To choose an icon pack, you will need to make sure that the icon pack adjusts to your website personality. Roundedness, weight, and filled/outlined depend on typography.
  - When to use icons:
    - To provide visual assistance to text.
    - For product feature blocks.
    - Use icons associated with actions i.e. buttons, navigation bars etc., and label them (unless no space or icons is 100% clear)
    - Icons for bullet points e.g. small checkbox icons for pricing plan.
  - How to use icons
    - To keep icons neutral, us the same color as text. To draw more attention, use different color.
    - Do not confuse your users: icons need to make sense and fit the text or action.
    - Don't make icons larger than what they were designed for. If needed, enclose them in a shape.
- Shadows
  - Shadow creates depth (3D): the more shadow, the further away from the interface the element is.
  - You don't have to use shadows if they don't fit your website personality. Only use them if it makes sense for the website personality.
  - Website looks more playful with more shadows, and they look serious with little to no shadow.
  - Use shadows in small doses, don't add them to every element.
  - Go light on shadows, don't make them too dark.
  - Use small shadows for smaller elements that should stand out (to draw attention).
  - Use medium sized shadows for larger areas that should stand out a bit more.
  - Use large shadows for elements that should really float above the interface.
  - Experiment with changing shadows on mouse interaction (click and hover)
  - Experiment with glows (colored shadows)
- Border Radius
  - Use border-radius to increase the playfulness and fun of the design, to make it less serious.
  - Typefaces have a certain roundness: make sure that border-radius matches that roundness.
  - Use border-radius on buttons, images, around icons, standout sections, and other elements.
- Whitespace
  - The right amount of whitespace makes designs look clean, modern, and polished.
  - Whitespace communicates how different pieces of information are related to one another.
  - Whitespace implies invisible relationships between the elements of a layout.
  - Use ton of whitespace between sections.
  - Use a lot of whitespace between groups of elements.
  - Use whitespace between elements.
  - Inside groups of elements, try to use whitespace instead of lines.
  - The law of proximity: The more some elements (or groups of elements) belong together, the closer they should be.
  - Start with a lot of whitespace, then remove whitespace from there until it looks right.
    - Too much whitespace looks detached, too little looks too crammed.
  - Match other design choices. If you have big text or big icons, you need more whitespace.
  - Try a hard rule, such as using multiples of 16px for all spacing.
- Visual Hierarchy
  - Visual Hierarchy is about establishing which elements of a design are the most important ones.
  - It is about drawing attention to these most important elements.
  - It is also about defining a "path" for users, to guide them through the page.
  - We use a combination of position, size, colors, spacing, borders, and shadows to establish a meaningful visual hierarchy between elements/components.
  - Position important elements closer to the top of the page, where they get more attention.
  - Use images mindfully, as they draw a lot of attention (larger images get more attention).
  - Whitespace creates separation, so use whitespace strategically to emphasize elements.
  - For text elements, use font-size, font-weight, text-color, background-color, and whitespace to convey importance.
  - What text elements to emphasize? Titles, sub-titles, links, buttons, data points, icons
    - You can also de-emphasize less important text, like labels or secondary/additional information.
  - Emphasize an important component using background-color, shadow, or border (or multiple).
  - Try emphasizing some component A over component B by de-emphasizing component B.
  - What components to emphasize? Testimonials, call-to-action sections, highlight sections, preview cards, forms, pricing tables, important rows/columns in tables, etc.
- User Experience (UX)
  - Steve Jobs: "Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works."
  - User Interface (UI) is the visual presentation of a product. It's how the graphical interface looks and feels like.
    - Layout
    - "Personality"
    - Typography, colors, icons, etc.
  - User Experience (UX) is the overall experience the user has while interacting with the product.
    - Does the app feel logical and well thought out?
    - Does the navigation work intuitively?
    - Are users reaching their goals?
  - UI is graphical interface, it is what make an interface beautiful.
  - UX is experience with interface, it is what makes an interface useful and functional.
  - UX Design cannot exist without UI Design.
  - A website or application exists for a reason: a user has a goal for visiting it, and a business has a goal for creating it.
  - Good UX design aligns the user's goals with the business' goals.
  - Don't design complicated layouts. Don't reinvent the wheel. Use patterns that users know.
  - Make your call-to-action the most prominent element, and make the text descriptive.
  - Use blue text and underlined text only for links.
  - Use blue text and underlined text only for links.
  - Animations should have a purpose and be fast: between 200ms and 500ms.
  - In forms, align labels and fields in a single vertical line, to make the form easier to scan.
  - Offer users good feedback for all actions: form, errors, form success, etc. [web apps]
  - Place action buttons where they will create an effect (law of locality) [web apps]
  - Use a descriptive, keyword-focused headline on your main page. Don't be vague or fancy!
  - Only include relevant information, efficiently. Cut out fluff and make the content 100% clear.
  - Use simple words. Avoid technical jargon and "smart-sounding" words.
  - Break up long text with sub-headings, images, block quotes, bullet points, etc.
- Website Personalities Framework
  - What is a website personality?
    - A website personality is basically like a general feeling, or a vibe that we want the website to transmit to our users.
    - It is also a feeling that we want to invoke in our users.
  - Choose one of the website personalities according to how you want the website to appear to users. What vibe do you want to transmit?

### HTML

- `<blockquote>` - The blockquote tag specifies a section that is quoted from another source. Browsers usually indent blockqoute elements.
- `<figure>` - The figure tag specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code, listings, etc. While the content of the figure element is related to the main flow, its position is independent of the main flow, and if removed it shoudl not affect the flow of the document.
- `<span>` - The span tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a doument. It is much like the `<div>` element but, `<div>` is a block-level element and `<span>` is an inline element.

### CSS

- SVG:
  - SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, it is used to define vector-based graphics for the web. It defined the graphics in XML format. Every element and every attribute in SVG files can be animated. SVG is a W3C recommendation and integrates with other W3C standards such as the DOM and XSL.
  - SVG images can be created and edited with any text editor. They can be searched, indexed, scripted, and compressed. They are scalable and can be printed with high quality at any resolution. They are zoomable and do NOT lose any quality if they are zoomed or resized. It is an Open Standard and their files are pure XML.
- SVG Properties:
  - `stroke: #000` - The stroke property defines the color of a line, text, or outline of an element.
  - `fill: #000` - The fill property is for filling in the color of a SVG shape.
- `box-shadow: 0 20px 30px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);` - The box-shadow property in CSS is for putting shadows on elements (sometimes referred to as "drop shadows")
  - 5 Values of box-shadow:
    - Horizontal Offset
    - Vertical Offset
    - The Blur Radius
    - The spread Radius
    - Color
- `text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px #000;`
  - 4 Values of text-shadow:
    - X-cordinate
    - Y-cordinate
    - Blur Radius
    - Color of Shadow
- `border-radius: 20px` - The border-radius property defines the radius of the element's corners. i.e. This property will allow you to add rounded corners to elements.
  - 4 values of border-radius:
    - top-left corner
    - top-right corner
    - bottom-right corner
    - bottom-left corner
