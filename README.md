# HTML-CSS BOOTCAMP

**About:** The goal of this course is to take you step by step from a complete beginner, all the way to building real world websites, while using tools and technologies that professional developers use every single day. To build real-world websites, you will learn real-world skills. Starting with the basics of sematic HTML, modern CSS, and building layouts using tools like Flexbox and even CSS Grid. You will then learn easy to use guidelines, so that you become one of the few developers who can also design; and with these skills mastered, we move to the Omnifood project, where you learn how to plan websites, how to use common design components and layout patterns, and how to find and use free design assets. You will also learn how make websites work on mobile devices, optimize it for top performance, and even launch it to the internet; and to make sure that you become a confident and independent developer, you will follow industries' best practices, write clean and organized code, and learn how to fix coding mistakes throughout the entire course.
